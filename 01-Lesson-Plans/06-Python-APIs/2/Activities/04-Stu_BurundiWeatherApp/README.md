# Weather in Bujumbura

This activity gives students practice with making API calls and handling responses.

## Instructions

* Gather all of your "config" information— your API key; the base URL; etc.—before moving on.

* Build your query URL. Check the documentation to figure out how to request temperatures in Celsius.

* Make your request, and save the API response.

* Retrieve the current temperature in Bujumbura from the JSON response.

* Print the temperature to the console.

## Bonus

* Augment your code to GET the temperature in both Fahrenheit _and_ Celsius.

### Note: Don't forget to change the API key in config.py!
